A 4-sparse tree adder based on the Intel Pentium 4 version of the valence-2 Sklansky architecture. It features a propagator/generator calculation network, a 4-sparse valence-2 carry calculation network and an array of 4-bit carry-select adders. Two specifications are available: 

* A fully structural specification (synthesized circuit shown below)
* An hybrid specification mixing dataflow and structural information
