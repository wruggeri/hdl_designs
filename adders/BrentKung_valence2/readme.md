A full tree adder based on the valence-2 Brent-Kung architecture. It features a valence-2 carry calculation network and a sum-computing XOR network. The carry-in is handled by adding a further PG computation level.
The provided testbench is composed by a simple random values generator, a behavioural golden model and some assertion-based checkers.
